# CO-OLX
Through this project, 
We tried to make process of buying and selling of second hand products like bicycle and other technical and non-technical stuff 
within the college campus a bit convenient by providing a platform where students can upload their products and others can explore 
among the products. 
Built using Flask framework of Python and used SQLite as database backend.
